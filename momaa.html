       <h2> <b>MOTHER THE SUPER WOMEN</b> </h2>
The most important person in the life of a person is his or her mother. 
There is also a super character in our real lives and that is the mother.
 So for me, that special character is my mom as she is a superwoman.
  Regardless of day and night, my mother is always there for me.
  Mother as we all know is the greatest blessing of God in everyone’s life.
   The love and sacrifice a mother holds in her heart for her child is immeasurable and undoubtedly the maximum. 
   A mother remains a mother for her child even if the child has now become an adult.

Without a mother the existence of this world is impossible and unimaginable.
 Mother is the first best friend or BFF as the children now say in a child’s life. 
 It is really hard to find a true best friend like her who supports us in every difficult situation and the good deeds we do but
  also helps us to take the right path in life.
